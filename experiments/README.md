Scripts used to run various additional experiments.

marginal_search.py and marginal_search_nonsep.py are scripts used to determine the highest FID subgroup only searching
the marginal subgroup space. This experiment is covered in Section 5.3 and Appendix L.

fair_compare.py and gerry_compare.py are used to evaluate the relationship of high FID subgroups to traditional
fairness metrics. This experiment is covered in Section 5.4.

generate_synthetic.ipynb generates the synthetic datasets used for the experiments in Appendix J.
